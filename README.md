# Distance Optimization Algorithm
This project provides a Python solution to find the minimum total distance from a set of coordinate points to a single optimal point using the **Median Algorithm**.

## Features
- Dynamic calculation based on any number of input points.
- Uses Python's built-in sorting for efficient median finding.
- Included test cases for verification.

## Concepts Applied
- Algorithms (Optimization)
- Data Structures (Lists/Arrays)
- Python Programming
